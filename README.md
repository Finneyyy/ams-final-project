# DevOps - Final Project

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments of the **Spring Pet Clinic** application, using tools that encapsulates concepts of all core modules covered during the training. 

The Project involves:

* Agile & Project Management
* Databases & Cloud Fundamentals
* Programming & Testing Fundamentals
* Continuous Integration
* Infrastructure as Code & Configuration Management
* Containerisation & Orchestration
* Cloud Configuration and Management

## Scope 

We will be working with these 2 externally developed applications:

* https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular
* https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest

The **spring-petclinic-angular** serves as a front-end client using _AngularJS_, whilst the **spring-petclinic-rest** serves as an _API_ using _Java_.

The applicaion should be deployed considering the following:
* Multiple Environment support: How can a developer test their new features on an environment before merging their changes to the main branch?
* Automation: How can changes on the GitHub repository automatically build and deploy to testing and live environments?
* Running costs: What are your monthly estimates? How could they be improved?

## Team Organization and Project Management 

Our team adopted an Agile approach to the project management, organizng the project into sprints, assigning scrum roles and providing a product a backlog. For project tracking we used a Trello board. Backlog Items were assigned story points, acceptance criteria and MoSCoW prioritisation, and moved from project backlog, to sprint backlog, to review and then complete as the project progressed. 
At the begining, the state of the Trello board was:

During the project, we had to do a few changes to the board, as you can see below:


At the end, we were able to complete all the sprints and tasks:

## Risk Assessment 

A risk assessment was designed to evaluate potential scenarios that may impact the project in a negative way. These measures could be implemented in the app such that these risks are less likely to occur. This initial risk assessment is shown below:

Some of the control measures implemented in the project to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring are as follows:


## Testing

Testing is a crucial part of software development.
